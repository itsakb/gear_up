/*GitHelper-Git Searching Tool*/

/*Intro*/

1.This Project is Hosted on GitHub Pages and the link is https://itsakb.github.io/gear_up/ 
2.This Project is made with Reactjs.
3.It uses framework like Tailwindcss for basic styling and GitHub REST API to fetch Contribution list for a given Repository.

/*Functionality*/

1.The website asks the user to enter the GitHub username and Repository name in order to get its contribution list and display it in a table.
2.The user can click on anyone’s username displayed in the table to visit their GitHub account in a new tab.   
3.If the user enters any wrong info for a given input field it will display message “No such repo found!”.
4.The user can press the reset button below the table to erase all input fields and search new repositories again.
5.The website includes two buttons that redirect you to another website in a new tab first one “learn more” (at header) which redirects you to the GitHub REST API docs and the second one is a LinkedIn logo (at bottom right of Footer) which redirects you to my (Abhilash Kumar Behera) LinkedIn profile.

/*Important info*/

1.If you are using a mobile device and have correctly inputted all fields make sure to swipe right/left on the table (swiping somewhere else other than table will not work) to view all the data properly.
